Everything you need to know about the Laye programming languages and its tools.

## How to pronounce it

Laye is pronounced \[`'la.jɛ`\] or \[`'la.je`\] (see the interactive [IPA chart](https://www.ipachart.com/) for pronunciation guides.) It is two syllables: "lah", as in "law" in my accent, and "yeh" as in "yellow", with the stress on the first syllable.

## First steps

If you're new to Laye, these are great places to start learning.

## Getting help

Having trouble or have a question?

- See if your question has already been answered on the [FAQ](FAQ).
- Report bugs to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/laye-lang/laye/issues).
- Need to talk to a human? There are plenty in the Forever Untitled [Discord server](https://discord.gg/paKyDFKJtr). Use the `#help-pls` channel for actual help, or join or spark a casual discussion in another channel if it's less serious.

## How the documentation is organized

Laye aims to provide a lot of thorough documentation. It's broadly organized into these four categories for your convenience.

- [Tutorials](Tutorials) take you along a path from start to finish for various simple topics. Start here if you're new to Laye to get a feel for how things are done!
- [How-to guides](How‐to-Guides) go more in depth on real-world, common problems. Take a look at these once you've dipped your toes in Laye and are looking to build the fundamentals.
- [Topic guides](Topic-Guides) provide high level explanations of key topics and concepts, often including background information. If you're curious about specific things you've encountered, see what you can learn from these.
- [References](References) contain technical details about the Laye programming language and its standard library APIs. If you need the formal information on a topic, check here for the nitty-gritty.

This is roughly equivalent to the four categories in the [Divio Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction.html). If you're interested in learning how to write documentation, I highly recommend giving it a read; it's very brief. If you want to contribute documentation, this is the system to follow.
