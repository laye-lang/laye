## How do you pronounce "Laye"?

Laye is pronounced \[`'la.j…õ`\] or \[`'la.je`\] (see the interactive [IPA chart](https://www.ipachart.com/) for pronunciation guides.) It is two syllables: "lah", as in "law" in my accent, and "yeh" as in "yellow", with the stress on the first syllable.

## Why is the "Hello, world" example called "Hello, hunter"?

I really like the game [Bloodborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne). My first tattoo was the Hunters Mark on my left wrist. I've been writing most of my "hello, world" programs with "hello, hunter" instead for a good few years now, so I wanted to introduce it as your first Laye program.

## I've encountered an issue! How do I file a bug report?

Head over to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/laye-lang/laye/issues) on the project's GitHub and first see if your issue has already been reported. The [documentation on contributing](Contributing) has a section detailing proper practice on opening issues.
